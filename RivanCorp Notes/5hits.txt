1. Network
	In order to find the network of the given ip address, the first step is to convert the slash /26 to rivan format.
	
		/26 = (4th octet, 64increment)
		
	
	Afterwards, think of a number that is closest to the specified octet (4th octet), that is also divisible by the specified increment (64 increment)
	
	In the given example: 192.168.45.232
		we are looking for a number closest to 232 (because it's the one on the 4th octet), and that number should also be divisible by 64 because that is our increment. (4th, 64i)
		
		64 + 64 + 64 = 192
		
		the number we are looking for is 192 because it is divisible by 64 and it's the closest to 232 without exceeding it.
		Now we simply place the number we found, 192, in the given ip address to the exact same placement specified by the rivan format, which is on the 4th octet.
		
		NETWORK: 192.168.45.192 /26
		
		Now this is going to be our network.
		
		This also means that the original example: 192.168.45.232 is an ip address located within the 192.168.45.192 /26 network. We can prove this after we get our IP range.
		
2. IP RANGE

	Now that we have our Network(192.168.45.192 /26) we can use it to get the first and last ip address.
	
	We simply add 1 to the Network
		192.168.45.192	+ 1
		192.168.45.193 = FIRST IP
		
	Next we need to get the last IP. In order to do that we have to find the next network. We can do this by simply using the rivan format of our Network's slash, which is /26 (4th octet, 64i)
	All we need to do is add the increment(64i) to the specified octet(4th) of our network. 
	
		Network: 192.168.45.192		+64 to the number on the 4th octet
		= 192.168.45.256	!!Note that each octet can only go up to 255, which means the next octet, the 3rd, will have to increase by 1 and the 4th octet will go back to zero.
		= 192.168.46.0
		
		192.168.46.0 is now our NEXT NETWORK
	
	Now in order to get the last IP of our NETWORK we will have to subtract 1 to the NEXT NETWORK
		192.168.46.0	- 1
		192.168.45.255 = This is now our LAST IP
	
	Therefore our IP RANGE is 192.168.45.193 - 192.168.45.255
	
3. BROADCAST
	The LAST IP is also considered to be the BROADCAST
	
	Therefore our BROADCAST is 192.168.45.255
	
4. HOST
	In order to get the host we have to use the slash from the given, /26, and subtract it to the constant /32
	/32 - /26 = 6
	
	the difference(6) is then used as an exponent for 2
	
	2^6 = 64
	
	then we subtract by 2
	
	64 - 2 = 62
	
	Therefore our HOST will be 62
	
	
	We can also say that the formula to get the host is
		2^(/32 - /givenSlash) - 2 = Host
	
5. SUBNET
	In order to get the subnet we have to be knowledgable about the original slashes of the old classful addressing method
Original Slash	Classful	Subnet Mask Class			Default			Private Range (Not routable on Internet)
/8				Class A		1-126.0.0.0		255.0.0.0		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
/16				Class B		128-191			255.255.0.0		172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 Default CIDR - /12
/24				Class C		192-223			255.255.255.0	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 Default CIDR - /16
				Class D		224-239
				Class E		240-254
	
	When it comes to finding the subnet the only thing we need to remember is that:
		If an IP address starts with 1-126 in their first octet (most examples you'll find 10.0.0.0), the original slash is /8
		
		If an IP address starts with 128-191 in their first octet (most examples you'll find 172.16.0.0), the original slash is /16
		
		If an IP address starts with 192-223 in their first octet (most examples you'll find 196.128.0.0), the original slash is /24
	
	Now that we know about the original slashes, we need to use it to find the subnet.
	
	In the example: 192.168.45.232 is a class C address with the very obvious 192.168, which means we will use the /24 and subtract it with the current slash (/26)
	/26 - /24 = 2
	then use the difference as an exponent in the power of 2
	2^2 = 4
	
	therefore we have 4 SUBNETS
